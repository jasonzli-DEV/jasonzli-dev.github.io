# Dinosaur Game

A recreation of the Google Chrome "No Internet" dinosaur game (T-Rex Runner) built with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Cacti are now taller (40-70px) and flying birds appear at higher altitudes (30-130px above ground)
- **Progressive Challenge**: Obstacles spawn closer together as your score increases, making the game increasingly difficult
- **Bird Obstacles**: Flying birds start appearing at 1000 points (increased challenge threshold)
- **Scoring System**: Earn points for each obstacle avoided, with persistent high score tracking
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Game speed increases as your score gets higher
- **Smooth Game Flow**: Single press restart from game over - no double press needed
- **Frozen Game Over**: Clouds freeze during game over state for better visual feedback
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Authentic Look**: Enhanced recreation of the original Chrome game aesthetic
